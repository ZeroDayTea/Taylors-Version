# Taylors-Version
Quick project implemented using React.js, node.js, and sqlite that manages users on a game and allows them to play a quiz for any of their favorite music artists. The quiz dynamically prompts the user with a lyric from a random song or selected album and asks players to guess which song the lyric corresponds to competing for a high score.
